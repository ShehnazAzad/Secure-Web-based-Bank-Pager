Hi, welcome to my journey of creating a secure, web-based chat application with message filtering technology using NLP, to solve the inconvenience of using social media platforms for inter-banking interactions between the bank employees and to comply with the information protection conventions of standards PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR.
This is a project assignment I have done on the latter part of my 3rd year of my bachelorâ€™s degree specializing on cyber security. It was pretty exciting and interesting to work on this amazing new idea. Hope you find it useful too.

Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create a front-end for your web-based chat application using React and incorporating the Signal Protocol library.

Step 1: Set up the Development Environment
Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and verify that Node.js is installed by running the following command:
   ```
   node -v
   ```

Step 2: Create a React Application
To create a new React application, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.

2. Run the following command to create a new React application:
   ```
   npx create-react-app (your-prefered-name-in-simple-letters)
   ```
 
 
3. Once the command finishes executing, navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd chat-app
   ```

4. Start the development server by running the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will open a new browser window with your React application running.

Step 3: Install Signal Protocol Library
To incorporate the Signal Protocol library into your React application, you need to install the necessary packages. Here's how:

1. Open a new terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.

2. Install the required library using the following command:
   ```
   npm install signal-protocol
   ```

Step 4: Design the Chat UI
Now, let's design the user interface (UI) of the chat application using HTML and CSS. Open the `src/App.js` file in your preferred code editor and replace its contents with the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { SignalProtocol } from 'signal-protocol';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <h1>Web-based Chat Application</h1>
      </header>
      <div className="ChatContainer">
        {/* Your chat UI code goes here */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Step 5: Implement the Chat Functionality
Next, you'll add the necessary JavaScript code to handle the chat functionality. Update the `src/App.js` file with the following code:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { SignalProtocol } from 'signal-protocol';

function App() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [newMessage, setNewMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    // Your code to establish a connection with the Signal Protocol server goes here
  }, []);

  const handleSendMessage = () => {
    // Your code to send a new message goes here
    setNewMessage('');
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <h1>Web-based Chat Application</h1>
      </header>
      <div className="ChatContainer">
        <div className="ChatMessages">
          {messages.map((message, index) => (
            <div key={index} className="Message">
              {message}
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
        <div className="ChatInput">
          <input
            type="text"
            value={newMessage}
            onChange={(e) => setNewMessage(e.target.value)}
          />
          <button onClick={handleSendMessage}>Send</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Step 6: Styling the UI with CSS
To style the chat application,

 you can create a new CSS file called `src/App.css` and add the following CSS code:

```css
.App {
  text-align: center;
}

.App-header {
  background-color: #282c34;
  padding: 20px;
  color: white;
}

.ChatContainer {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 400px;
  width: 400px;
  margin: 20px auto;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 20px;
  overflow: auto;
}

.ChatMessages {
  flex: 1;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start;
  overflow-y: scroll;
}

.Message {
  background-color: #eee;
  padding: 5px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.ChatInput {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  margin-top: 10px;
}

input[type='text'] {
  flex: 1;
  margin-right: 10px;
}
```

With these steps, you have a basic front-end for your web-based chat application using React and incorporating the Signal Protocol library. Feel free to further customize the UI and implement the required functionality for establishing a connection and sending/receiving messages using the Signal Protocol.
